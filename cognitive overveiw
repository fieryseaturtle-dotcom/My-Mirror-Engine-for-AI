our README.md or its own section labeled "Cognitive Architecture Overview":

🧭 Four Core Perspectives of the Mirror Engine

The Mirror Engine framework operates across four distinct but interconnected layers of self-observation. Each offers a unique perspective for modeling thought, emotion, and internal feedback:

Perspective	Function	Description
🪞 Mirror	Cognitive reflection	Surfaces belief structures, emotional tone, and idea frequency over time.
🌑 Shadow	Contradiction detection	Identifies suppressed schema, logical dissonance, and recurring instability.
🕯️ Ritual	Perspective intervention	Applies structured framing routines to break loops and enable recontextualization.
🔎 Lens	Perception bias profiling	Detects dominant cognitive filters and framing tendencies before reflection begins.

Together, these perspectives form a closed-loop introspective system, allowing users to move fluidly between insight, disruption, transformation, and meta-awareness.

Would you like me to convert this into a Markdown component block or collapsible section for easier GitHub integration?
