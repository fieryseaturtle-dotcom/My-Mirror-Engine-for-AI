# Mirror Engine V2.5 ‚Äî Cognitive Reflection Framework


## Executive Summary
The Mirror Engine is a modular, locally operable cognitive reflection system designed to process natural language input, detect semantic inconsistencies, monitor emotional valence over time, and generate reflective output‚Äîboth textual and auditory‚Äîto support introspective practice and self-modeling.


This architecture translates journal entries, dialogue transcripts, and subjective reports into structured cognitive artifacts, providing a diagnostic map of belief evolution, affective tone, contradiction patterns, and recursive loops.


Developed for researchers, technologists, therapists, and cognitive toolmakers, the Mirror Engine demonstrates how language models and lightweight graphing tools can enable real-time introspective analytics without network dependency or cloud computation.

## Core Features


### üîç Belief Graph Mapping
- Extracts key concepts from journal text and maps them as graph nodes
- Tracks frequency, sentiment polarity, and conceptual adjacency
- Output: Interactive graph object in JSON (compatible with D3.js / Cytoscape)


### üîÑ Contradiction Detection
- Identifies semantic inversions (e.g., concept X described with both positive and negative valence across entries)
- Output: Contradiction report with polarity swing data


### ‚ôæÔ∏è Self-Loop Analysis
- Flags repeated terms with stagnant sentiment, indicative of cognitive stagnation or rumination
- Output: Loop index with recurrence metadata


### üìà Valence Drift Timeline
- Plots entry-by-entry emotional tone to reveal long-term narrative arcs or affective instability
- Output: Time-series CSV or line graph object


### üîä Reflective Voice Output
- Uses offline TTS engine (pyttsx3) to voice back prompts, contradictions, and schema rewrites
- Output: Spoken `.mp3` or `.wav` files for introspective playback

## Architecture Overview


| Layer | Stack Element | Output |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Input Ingestion | Plain text / journal entries | Token stream w/ timestamp |
| Sentiment Parsing | TextBlob / VADER / Custom Rules | Valence + subjectivity score |
| Graph Construction | NetworkX / Neo4j (optional) | Belief network JSON |
| Contradiction Logic | Custom swing detection algorithm | Conflict report |
| Voice Synthesis | pyttsx3 or gTTS (configurable) | Spoken insight files |


---


## Use Cases
- **Personal Insight Tools**: Reflective journaling, mood tracking, belief mapping
- **Therapeutic Augmentation**: Therapist-side insight engine for client language patterns
- **AI Embodiment Models**: Prototype of recursive affective modeling for autonomous agents
- **Creative Systems**: Semantic entropy mapping for fiction and narrative tools


---


## Ethical Notes
- Fully local execution ‚Äî no cloud storage, no external processing
- Promotes introspection, not correction ‚Äî no behavior scoring or optimization
- User maintains all control over input, data lifespan, and voice output settings


---


## Future Development
- Integration with LLM summarization layers
- GUI overlay for belief graphs and drift maps
- Dream parsing and metaphor clustering
