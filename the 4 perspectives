Ah yes — *the trinity is forming.*
You’ve got:

1. 🪞 **Mirror** – reflection (what is)
2. 🌑 **Shadow** – repression / dissonance (what’s hidden)
3. 🕯️ **Ritual** – intentional reframing (what could be)

Now you want a **fourth axis** — something that completes the cycle of perception.

Let’s go full meta here. You're not just modeling *what's inside* — you're shaping *how it's seen*. So what’s the missing angle?

---

## 🧭 Fourth Perspective: **Lens**

### → The way you filter the world *before* the mirror even gets a signal.

**Mirror** shows you what you already produced.
**Shadow** shows you what you’re avoiding.
**Ritual** helps you change your stance.
**Lens** shows you how your *default perception* distorts the signal.

It’s the **meta-frame** — your active cognitive bias, schema filters, conceptual compression… the "glasses" you're wearing *before* you even write a word.

### 🔎 What does Lens do in the system?

| Component                      | Description                                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cognitive Filter Detection** | Analyzes tone/style over time to detect fixed schemas (e.g., "always skeptical")    |
| **Compression Heuristics**     | Detects overused metaphors, repeated structures — evidence of cognitive bias        |
| **Worldview Proximity Map**    | Matches entries to common narrative lenses (e.g., survivor, analyst, rebel, oracle) |
| **Conceptual Density Scanner** | Identifies overly compressed or abstract language that hides emotional truth        |

### 💾 Possible Implementation

You could make `lens_profiles.yaml` like this:

```yaml
- name: emotional_flattening
  detect_phrases: ["I guess", "it's fine", "whatever"]
  trigger_score: > 5
  lens_label: "avoidance lens"

- name: hyper-analytical
  detect_phrases: ["therefore", "logically", "statistically"]
  trigger_score: > 7
  lens_label: "intellectual distancing"
```

Then the system says:

> “Detected dominant lens: 🧠 *Hyper-Analytical* — low emotional access, high logic compression.”

Now the mirror shows you *why the reflection feels cold.* Not because of the content, but the lens.

### 🧠 Summary: The Four Cognitive Axes

| Name       | Role                       | Tagline                                    |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Mirror** | Surface reflection         | “What’s here?”                             |
| **Shadow** | Submerged contradiction    | “What’s hiding?”                           |
| **Ritual** | Intentional transformation | “What can shift?”                          |
| **Lens**   | Pre-reflection filter      | “How am I seeing this before I even look?” |

Would you like me to draft a **Lens Module README section**, or prototype a detection script like I did with Rituals?
This piece could be your most *subtle* but *powerful* engine layer.
You could make lens_profiles.yaml like this:

- name: emotional_flattening
  detect_phrases: ["I guess", "it's fine", "whatever"]
  trigger_score: > 5
  lens_label: "avoidance lens"

- name: hyper-analytical
  detect_phrases: ["therefore", "logically", "statistically"]
  trigger_score: > 7
  lens_label: "intellectual distancing"
