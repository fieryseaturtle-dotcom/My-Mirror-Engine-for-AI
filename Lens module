🧠 Mirror Engine – Lens Module
🔍 Overview

The Lens Module is a cognitive filter detector that identifies dominant perceptual patterns—also called "lenses"—within journal entries, self-dialogues, or any reflective data stream. It adds a fourth axis of introspection to the Mirror Engine ecosystem: not just what you think, but how you habitually see the world.

Where the Mirror reflects, the Shadow reveals, and Rituals reframe, the Lens module detects cognitive framing bias.

⚙️ How It Works

Input: Journal entries or text reflections.

Config: lens_profiles.yaml – user-defined regex patterns and lens labels.

Output: Ranked breakdown of dominant lenses based on detected patterns.

Lenses are determined by scanning your text for recurring phrases or structures associated with known cognitive filters—like avoidance, hyper-analysis, or emotional compression.

🧪 Example Output
🧠 Dominant Perceptual Lenses Detected:
- Intellectual Distancing: 60% influence
- Avoidance Lens: 40% influence

This tells the user that recent reflections were shaped more by detachment and suppression than emotional accessibility.

📝 Define Your Own Lenses (lens_profiles.yaml)
- name: emotional_flattening
  label: "Avoidance Lens"
  detect_phrases:
    - "\\bwhatever\\b"
    - "I guess"
    - "doesn’t matter"


- name: hyper_analytical
  label: "Intellectual Distancing"
  detect_phrases:
    - "logically"
    - "statistically"
    - "no point"

You can add as many lenses as you like.

🧩 How Lens Fits the Mirror Engine Stack
Layer	Function
Mirror	Reflect thoughts
Shadow	Reveal blind spots
Rituals	Reframe perception
Lens	Detect habitual cognitive filters

Together, they form a full-loop cognitive self-modeling engine.

✅ To Run:
python lens_module.py

Make sure lens_profiles.yaml is in the same folder or linked via path.

This module is optional—but powerful. It helps reveal how your worldview is shaped, not just what it contains.
