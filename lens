‚úÖ Your **Lens Module** script is live.

This version:

* Analyzes a list of journal entries
* Matches recurring thought patterns to symbolic ‚Äúlenses‚Äù
* Outputs a breakdown of which perceptual filter dominates your current cognition

Example result:

```
üß† Dominant Perceptual Lenses Detected:
- Intellectual Distancing: 60% influence
- Avoidance Lens: 40% influence
```

Next options:

* Build a `lens_profiles.yaml` config system like rituals
* Feed this into the main Mirror Engine UI
* Expand lenses to include archetypes, mythic roles, or emotional suppressors
